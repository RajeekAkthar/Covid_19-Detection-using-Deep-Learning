# Covid-19 Detection using Deep Learning

## About
A Django based Web Application to detect the presence of [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19) in Chest X-Ray Images. The Deep Learning models are trained on a publicly available dataset of ~21000 Chest X-Ray Images labelled as COVID-19 or Non-COVID or Normal. The models were trained separately on the dataset and the weightfiles were later loaded onto the Webapp to detect the presence of COVID-19
